\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This document shows the general structure and specific implementation details to provide clarity on the project's direction and targeted features. Version 2 reflects the second checkpoint, where the import funciton is integrated and models in '.obj' format can be parsed and rendered in the viewport. It will ensure developers and stakeholders alike agree upon the direction of the program's development.
\subsection{Intended Audience}
Our intended audience includes: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Software Developers
    \item All stakeholders
	\item Project Managers
	\item Quality Assurance Teams/Testers
\end{itemize}
 
\subsection{System Overview}
The program now allows importing '.obj' models into a scene, parsing them with Assimp, and rendering them using OpenGL through the OpenTK wrapper. This marks the transition from a placeholder interface to a functional prototype. Although exports and simplification features remained planned for later, the user will be satisfied with their changes that they can export, make cuts, and folds to the models in a scalable vector graphics file (.svg).

\section{System Architecture}
This section provides a high-level overview of UnBox3D's architectural design.

\subsection{System Purpose and Goals}

The program seeks to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allow simplifying models
    \item Automate the unfolding process
    \item Provide visual feedback during simplification
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General Workflow:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Import Model:} Users can now import a model into the scene that is in '.obj' format.
	\item \textbf{Model Parsing:} Assimp is used to parse the imported model's data and create a mesh representation that can be manipulated within the application.
    \item \textbf{Model Rendering:} The model is rendered in the viewport for the user to begin the simplification process.
    \item \textbf{Simplification:} The user has the option to simplify the model by removing objects that are smaller than a certain threshold, or by Blender's decimation modifier where a given object has its geometry simplified while keeping the topology similar to before based on faces' angle constraints.
    \item \textbf{Export:} The model is passed to Blender where it is unfolded using a Blender extension that automatically unfolds geometry islands and marks the cuts and folds for reassembly.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Flow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When the user imports a model, an Assimp mesh is created
    \item The Assimp mesh passes its data to a g3 mesh (DMesh3) so we can modify the data during simplification
    \item Every frame, the data is passed from the g3 mesh to an AppMesh (a custom data container created by us)
    \item The AppMesh data is passed into buffers for the GPU to access, with the help of OpenTK
\end{enumerate}
\section{User Interface}
This sections describes the UI and how it is implemented.
\subsection{Overview}
There are 2 main screens in this program: the splash screen and the viewport.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Splash Screen:} The logo is shown as the program loads
    \item \textbf{Viewport:} The viewport features an Import button, a region where the scene is rendered, and an Export button for unfolding.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Viewport Refreshing}
The program is able to refresh the viewport effectively thanks to OpenTK, a wrapper for OpenGL. It takes the data from AppMesh instances and constantly updates the buffers for the GPU to render objects accurately at every frame.
